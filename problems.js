// Section Two: Problem Solving

/* In this section you will be asked to put together the things you have been taught in ways that you have not encountered yet.
    This is a common problem in programming. Nearly everything you encounter in the real world will not match perfectly with any lesson plan. 
    You will need to think logically about the tools at your disposal, and use research aids such as Google and StackOverflow in order to unblock yourself.
    Remember, you have your TAs, mentor, and peer commnuity to ask questions to.
    You can do this, even if it seems challenging. The challenge is part of the experience of being a programmer. 
    Even people who have been coding for decades face new problems they need to think about in new ways.

    You need to do several things. You need to iterate over an array to access each object contained in the array. You need to have some way to quickly and easily access this object or it's keys.
    You then need to search inside that object to see if it has the key you are looking for. Finally, you need to add this key to your return array, or -1, and repeat with the next index.
